There are the basics of humanity the moment when everything come together. Al the thoughts and intersections of the process become available, the concrete nature of these spaces seems to extend outward as if these things are not part of the process, they range free, moving through space in some noncommittal way, waiting for the sectional experience.  That creation of the imaginationary space brings to the mind a sense of peace and we move forward with near misses, those simple criteria that make us who we are there more things to think about.  more ways to move through space than thisâ€¦   we think we are invincible to we realize what invincible means, not immortal. It would be to easy to live forward in that glass that state that begins what we call a section of lines.  These they are surreal and somewhat equal to the finest thing .  They await that time span that is without a doubt the best of all the worlds.  That is not immortality is the process that stops immorality and their we process the thoughts faster and with less consistency.
